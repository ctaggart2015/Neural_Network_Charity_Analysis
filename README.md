# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
Neural Networks, Deep Machine Learning Models, and tensorflow.
## Overview of the analysis: 
In this challenge we are asked to help Bek in the foundation Alphabet soup. They want to predict where they shoud make there investments. With the use of neural networks and deep machine learning models we can apply this to create visuals to determine which would be better.
## Results:
### Data Preprocessing

#### What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
The target variable would be in the IS_SUCCESSFUL column.

#### What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
The variables that are considered to be the features are application type, affiliation, classification,use_case, organization, status, income_amt, special_considerations, aand sk_am. 

#### What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
The variables that should be removed is ein and name.

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

#### How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?

#### Were you able to achieve the target model performance?

#### What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

## Summary:
